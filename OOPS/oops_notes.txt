Static Function Members
By declaring a function member as static, you make it independent of any particular object of the class. A static member function can be called even if 
no objects of the class exist and the static functions are accessed using only the class name and the scope resolution operator ::.

What is a static member in C++?
When a data member is declared as static , only one copy of the data is maintained for all objects of the class.
